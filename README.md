# Diabetes Prediction Model 🧠💉

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes using patient data. It's part of the **AI Anatomy** hackathon challenge.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Machine learning model training & evaluation
- Model explainability (e.g., SHAP, feature importance)
- Easy-to-read results and metrics

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- [Add any others like XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.]
